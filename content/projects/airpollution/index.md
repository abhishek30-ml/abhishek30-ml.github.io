Aimed to support climate change mitigation and urban planning through environmental monitoring

Proposed a generative modelling approach to reconstruct multi-variable air pollution field (PM2.5, NO2, O3) from sparse sensor points, trained on simulation data

Developed and compared score-based diffusion models against Transformer and Gaussian Process methods
