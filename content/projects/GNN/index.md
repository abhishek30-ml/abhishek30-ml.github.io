To visualise the fine-grained variations in brain connectivity, high spatial resolution fMRI data is needed, which can be very costly. To circumvent this issue, we leverage the capabilities of generative Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict high-resolution brain connectivity graphs from their low-resolution counterparts.

Developed a Generative GNN for reconstructing fMRI data consisting of 3 main blocks: Node Embedding Block, Super Resolution Block, Discriminator Block

Achieved MAE of 0.14, outperforming SOTA
