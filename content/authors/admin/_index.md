I am a Masters student in AI/ML at Imperial College London with specialization in Deep Learning and Generative AI. Previously worked 2 years in Tokyo at NTT-AT in telecom industry creating proprietary algorithms for anamoly detection (time series) and failure routing (graphs). Passionate about applying safe-ML to high impact areas such as environmental systems and healthcare while pushing the boundaries of AI. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in mountains, street photography and reading fiction.
